## Overview

Macrometa's global data mesh platform enables high-performance, real-time data management across regions. This repository provides a set of scripts that simplify common tasks when working with Macrometa, such as account migrations, cloning collections or geo fabrics, exporting query workers, backing up configurations, and managing acknowledgments across regions.

## Scripts

### accountMigration
- **Purpose:** Migrates an account from one feed to another.
- **Details:** Use this script to seamlessly transfer account data without manual intervention.

### cloneCollection
- **Purpose:** Clones collections from one account/fabric to another.
- **Details:** Ideal for replicating collection configurations across different environments.

### cloneFabric
- **Purpose:** Clones a geo fabric.
- **Details:** Simplifies the process of duplicating geo fabric setups in various locations.

### exportQueryWorkers
- **Purpose:** Exports all query workers from your Macrometa account.
- **Details:** Generates an export file containing query worker configurations for backup or migration.

### returningMoreThan1000doc
- **Purpose:** Returns documents in batches to work around Macrometa's 10k document limit.
- **Details:** Use this script when querying large datasets to avoid hitting the limit.

### tempBackup
- **Purpose:** Exports all data and configurations as JSON.
- **Details:** A temporary backup solution to capture your current Macrometa setup.

### waitForACK
- **Purpose:** Ensures that you receive acknowledgments (ACK) from all regions before continuing.
- **Details:** Helps maintain data consistency and regional synchronization.

### waitForACK-StreamWorkers
- **Purpose:** Similar to waitForACK, but specifically tailored for stream worker processes.
- **Details:** Waits for ACKs in stream worker operations to ensure reliable processing.
